### Phase 3: Configuration & Main Application

- [x] **Task 10: Create configuration files**
  - Build config/camera_config.yaml and config/tracking_rules.yaml for system settings
  - Status: COMPLETED ✅
  - Files: camera_config.yaml (camera settings, RTSP, presets), ai_config.yaml (YOLO model, device), tracking_rules.yaml (zones, triggers, filters)
  - Validated: All configs load successfully

- [x] **Task 11: Build main application**
  - Create src/main.py as entry point to run the tracking system
  - Status: COMPLETED ✅
  - Implementation: 490+ lines
  - Features: CLI interface, component initialization, tracking loop, statistics logging, graceful shutdown
  - Capabilities: Display mode, duration limits, PTZ control toggle, configurable logging
  - Validated: Successfully ran 20-second test with real camera (192.168.1.107), all components initialized
  - Additional: Created run.py interactive launcher, docs/RUNNING.md guide
  - Debugging: Fixed 8 runtime errors (RTSP URL, parameters, Unicode encoding, statistics)
  - Tools: Created scripts/get_stream_uri.py (ONVIF stream discovery), scripts/test_stream_urls.py

### Phase 4: Testing & Web Dashboard

## Notes

- Follow conventional commit format for all git commits
- Keep root directory clean - only README.md as .md file
- Use feature branches - never commit directly to main
- Update this file as tasks are completed
